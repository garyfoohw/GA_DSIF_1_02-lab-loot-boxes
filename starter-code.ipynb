    "### Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're an analyst for [Zynga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zynga), a gaming studio working on an event for an MMO (massively multiplayer online) game. This event is going to include **loot boxes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/2007scape/images/0/06/Culinaromancer%27s_chest.png/revision/latest?cb=20180403231423\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"150\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "A loot box is basically a treasure chest in a game. This loot box can be opened to reveal a variety of items: some items are very rare and valuable, other items are common and less valuable. (You may consult [the esteemed Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box) for a more extensive definition.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our specific game, suppose that loot boxes can be obtained in one of two ways: \n",
    "- After every three hours of playing the game, a user will earn one loot box.\n",
    "- If the user wishes to purchase a loot box, they may pay $1 (in real money!) for a loot box.\n",
    "\n",
    "These loot boxes are very good for our business!\n",
    "- If a player earns a loot box, it means they are spending lots of time on the game. This often leads to advertisement revenue, they may tell their friends to join the game, etc.\n",
    "- If the player purchases a loot box, it means we've earned $1 from our customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose each loot box is opened to reveal either:\n",
    "- magical elixir (super rare, very valuable), or\n",
    "- nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether each loot box contains the elixir or nothing is **random**. Our boss wants some guidance on what sort of randomness to use on these loot boxes! \n",
    "- If the magical elixir is too rare, then users may not be motivated to try to get them, because they believe they'll never find the magical elixir.\n",
    "- If the magical elixir is too common, then users may not be motivated to try to get them, because the game has so much of the magical elixir that it isn't worthwhile to try to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our boss isn't a math-y type person! When explaining things to our boss, we need to explain the impact of our choices on the game as concretely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version 1\n",
    "In our first version of the game, we'll say that loot boxes contain magical elixir 15% of the time and nothing 85% of the time.\n",
